# Dress4Less-marketplace
Dress4Less is an online marketplace project using Django framework.
Hi there! thank you for stopping by.

Dress4Less is a project where I practice building a website using Django framework. It is a online marketplace where people can go on, sign up to have their own account, 
and post any pre-owned items that they would wish to pass down to other people with a fraction of the price. It has a search function and a contact seller function which
I think is very useful and practical. Admin can have access to all databases and conversations to monitor and maintain a reciprocal manner environment. 

I hope you are getting some inspiration in this.

Peace !
