# Dress4Less-marketplace
Dress4Less is an online marketplace project using Django framework.
Hi there! thank you for stopping by.

Dress4Less is a website I built using Django framework. It is an online marketplace where people can go on, sign up to have their own account, and post any pre-owned items that they would wish to pass down to other people with a fraction of the price. It has a search function and a contact seller function which I think is very useful and practical. Admin can have access to all databases and conversations to monitor and maintain a reciprocal community.

This project is a combination of HTML where the user interface is properly laid out and Python running on the background to make sure that the search, contact seller, etc functions working seamlessly. 

Please go to the repository, download and give it a try !
